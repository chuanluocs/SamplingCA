# Badges

We apply for the following badges: 
- **Available**. We have a [public Github repository](https://github.com/chuanluocs/SamplingCA) for *SamplingCA*. 
- **Functional**. We have provided detailed instructions for building and running *SamplingCA* in the README file. 
- **Reusable**. Our implementation is organized in a modular way so that the code can be reused. Besides, all the testing instances are available, and we have instructions on how to reproduce the experimental results in the README file.
